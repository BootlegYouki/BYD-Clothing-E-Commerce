                    Placing an order constitutes an offer to purchase a product, subject to availability and order confirmation. Prices and product descriptions may change without notice. We reserve the right to cancel any order due to stock shortages, pricing errors, or suspected fraudulent activity.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>3. Payment and Transactions</strong><br>
                    All payments must be processed through PayMongo, our official payment gateway. No other payment methods will be accepted. Once a payment is confirmed, transactions are final. Refunds and cancellations will be handled per our return policy.</p>

                    Our chatbot provides automated responses to frequently asked questions. However, complex issues such as refunds, returns, and exchanges require direct contact with our customer support team. The chatbot is limited to text-based interactions and does not support voice commands.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>5. Shipping and Returns</strong><br>
                    Shipping costs and estimated delivery times will be provided at checkout. We are not responsible for delays caused by courier services. Returns and refunds are subject to our return policy, and customers must follow the proper process to request them.</p>

                    <p><strong>8. Account Verification and Security</strong><br>
                    For security purposes, we utilize One-Time Password (OTP) verification sent to your registered email address for certain transactions and account activities. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your OTP and account information. Any activities that occur under your account are your responsibility. We may collect location information that you provide during registration or checkout to improve service delivery and fraud prevention.</p>
