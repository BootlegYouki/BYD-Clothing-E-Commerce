By accessing and using our website, you agree to follow these Terms and Conditions along with our Privacy Policy, which may be updated without prior notice. Please read these terms carefully before using our services.</p>
                    <p><strong>1. Intellectual Property</strong><br>
                    All content on this website, including text, images, graphics, and logos, is owned or licensed by BYD Clothing.

                    <p><strong>2. Product Orders and Availability</strong><br>
                    Placing an order means you are offering to buy a product, but all purchases depend on availability and confirmation. Prices and product details may change at any time. We may cancel orders due to stock shortages, pricing mistakes, or suspected fraud.</p>
                    <p><strong>3. Payment and Transactions</strong><br>
                    All payments must be made through PayMongo, our official payment gateway. We do not accept other payment methods. Once a payment is confirmed, it is final. Refunds and cancellations will be handled according to our return policy.</p>
                    <p><strong>4. Chatbot and Customer Support</strong><br>
                    Our chatbot provides automated answers to common questions. However, issues like refunds, returns, and exchanges require direct assistance from our customer support team. The chatbot can only handle text-based messages and does not support voice commands.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. Shipping and Delivery</strong><br>
                    Shipping costs and estimated delivery times will be displayed at checkout. We are not responsible for courier delays. Returns and refunds follow our return policy, and customers must complete the proper process to request them.</p>

                    Users must use the website legally and should not engage in fraud, abuse, or unauthorized access. Any violations may lead to account suspension or legal action.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. Privacy and Security</strong><br>
